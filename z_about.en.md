Proffesionally I'm always somewhere on the IT orbit, currently changing position every six months 
as a part of leadership program of one of the corporations. This rotations I'm working on deployment
of the sales solution based on Apttus in the European countries.

My prior experience is as a web-applications developer (Scala/Java/AngularJS) and I still see my future in tech.

Personally I deeply believe in existence of the wolrd outside of Internet and there is a variety of topics which
make me blush from excitment nad I hope to share them with you here.

As a hobby, I'm notoriously engaging in unsuccessful projects to rule the world.
