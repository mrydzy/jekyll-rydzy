Professionally I'm always somewhere on the IT orbit, currently changing position every six months 
as a part of leadership program in one of the leading industrial companies. This cycle I'm working on deployment
of the complex CRM solution.

My prior experience is as a web-applications developer (Scala/Java/AngularJS) and I still try to stay up to date with dev world news.

Personally I deeply believe in existence of the wolrd outside of Internet and there is a variety of topics which
make me blush from excitement and I hope to share them with you here.

As a hobby, I'm notoriously engaging in unsuccessful projects aiming to rule the world.
