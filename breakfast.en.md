When I was a small girl I wanted to always have a drip under a T-shirt, so I wouldn't need to eat. Eating is neither fun, nor interesting and in addition,
it is time consuming and you cannot do it in advance. Makes no sense.

There is one exception - breakfast food! Especially the one which will make me full for entire day.

Encouraged by the questions 'where to go for Breakfast' in addition 'best around Kazimierz, not too pricy and with fast staff, so I can catch a flight at noon from Balice'
I've decided to create small map for all fellow breakfast lovers.
