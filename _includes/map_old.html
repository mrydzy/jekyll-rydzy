                    For Windows Phone you would need XAML and C#. Have in mind that even Snapchat didn't bother to to code for Windows Phone, so there are very few situations in which you should do so.

Mentioning it makes me feel a little bit guilty, since it may seem that I'm trying to trick you into browser-based solution again. Yes, that's true that Cordova actually runs in a browser, but it's very unlikely that your user will realize that! Check out some implementations to see it yourself. It's huge advantage it's simplicity - solution can be delivered using exclusively JS, HTML and CSS. I had a pleasure to test the   plugin, which enables to develop for mobile using AngularJS. It was extremely easy to get started and the development proceeded surprisingly, fast as long as I was using very typical use cases. When it came to using some plugins it took me ages to discover that relatively popular one wasn't yet working with newest software version and errors weren't my configuration's fault. It has been 2 years ago and the community has grown since then a lot since then, so that argument most probably isn't valid anymore. If you're considered about the future of the framework - well, you never know, but Cordova is backed by Adobe, who donated it to Apache Foundation.

If you don't believe that, you might want to check those apps out.
                    Solution seems to be extremely handy. Additionally blessing from Zuckerberg's corporation increases chances that the support for it won't stop after community finds new hype topic.

                    You can either download Wordpress and deploy yourself or simply buy a hosting with everything you need pre-installed. You just need to pick one of numerous templates, which you can customize without any coding skills, add some content and are good to go.
                    Disadvantages? Huge customization of existing templates at the beginning is quite painful.
                    So that's by far the best choice if you find the pre-existing template that meets your needs (or are planning to create one) - in other cases just worth considering.

                    Well you can use it, I'm just not sure why to do it, but I also don't see why not. If you have any good arguments for one of the other, please let me know!
                    Just please don't use .NET Forms since they are quite outdated solution.

                    Haml and Jade (which actually derived from Haml) are markup languages, simplifying HTML syntax and replacing inline page template engines. When templates are useful? Whenever you want to display some server-calculated values inside of well formatted HTML. For example if you want to send a nicely formatted email to many users and but include some personalised data - like their username or purchases - use their name and list of their purchases - you might want to use templates. <br/>
                    There are rumors that Haml and Jade can be useful on some other occasions - I haven't been given to experience that, yet.

                    <p>Pre-processors will pay off especially in big projects, where you want to create the common base
                        for the stylesheets and support the code for a long, long time.
                        Thanks to them, you will be able to extend the css classes and define some logic (make
                        background darker if font color is light), which will save you time not only on development but
                        also on any future changes.

                        There are plenty of tools, like Compass, supporting life reloading of css, whenever you change
                        something in sass or less.

                        Which one to choose? For my website I used sass, because of (<a href="https://css-tricks.com/sass-vs-less/"> this article </a>).

                    <p><a href="http://coffeescript.org/">Coffeescript</a> is a simple pre-processor, which enables you
                        to write js code faster. Instead of curved brackets you use proper indentation, you can omit
                        'function' and 'return' statements and easily iterate ever an array.
                        99% times it'll save you from some small work, but when you'll have problem with it, you might
                        struggle for ages to spot it.

                        <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/" >Typescript</a> is a typed
                        superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
                        How cool is that? And I'm not done yet. It also adds classes, constructors, interfaces... if you
                        like that stuff and rather handle compile-time errors, that's good stuff for you.</p>

                    Angular used to be my favourite one. And it's very clear why - with AngularJs you write services and controllers - just like on the backend! It's especially good for data binding - you can easily display the variables and even loop through the arrays as well as use conditional statements connecting your js-code to the interface. That comes with a price - it's quite resource-consuming, but unless you will use hundreds of permanently watched objects, you shouldn't worry too much. Remember that Angular 2.0 will not be backward compatible! <br/>

                        so let's have a closer look.
                        With React, instead of separating the technologies (HTML, CSS and JS), we separate whole logical
                        entities instead, grouping it and encapsulating inside components.
                        There is no good, old MVC, but an architecture called Flux (or going further Reflux or Redux).
                        Zuckerberg uses Flux, so this is what I will discuss.
                        User and API's communicate with Actions - those are simple helpers passing info to dispatchers.
                        Dispatchers broadcast whatever is needed to registered callbacks (stored in Store) which can
                        communicate back with the view. That's not the place to go into the details, but rather to get
                        your attention. If it got also your interest, you might want to read<a

                        Ah, and worth mentioning - React doesn't have it's own router. You might use a third-party
                        module for that, though.</p>

                    Backbone gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface. And that was copied directly from Backbone's website, because all I know about this framework is that is used to be
                    very popular, but seems to be losing attention now.

                    I must say I still liked Neo4j slightly more, but licence is much more business friendly here.

                    Mongo db means cheaper inserts with lower transactional security. If you need to store lots of the data, which do not require extra security nor structure (there is no schema!), that's the way to go.
