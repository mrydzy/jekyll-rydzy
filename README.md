# jekyll-rydzy
My personal website, migrated to jekyll

>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server.

So it takes the files you can see it this repo and splits out nicely organized website, witch can function as a blog. Where's the gain? 
In contrast to Wordpress or other cmses, everything is simple HTML and JS, without any backend logic or database. For simple cases let's use simple solutions!

Generated files by default are in _site folder, which I didn't commit to git. You can either easily generate it yourself or check it out life demo see www.rydzy.pl.
To test it you can dowload source code, install jekyll on your computer and simply run 'jekyll run' from the project root in the command line.


It is used by github pages, so actually I could even easily host my website here.
